# Placement-Management-System


The purpose of the project “PLACEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”, the manual work makes the process slow and other problems such as inconsistency and ambiguity on operations. In order to avoid this, a web based placement managed system is proposed, where the student information in the college with regard to placement is managed efficiently.


Placement management system helps the training and placement officers to overcome the difficulty in keeping records of hundreds and thousands of students and searching the eligible students for recruitment, based on various eligibility criteria of different companies. It helps in effective and efficient utilization of the hardware and the software resources.
